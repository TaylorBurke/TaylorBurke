Hello world! I am currently working at Power Innovations in American Fork, where I get to build applications for internal use as well as bring products to market. I use Java and JavaScript mostly, but I'm getting more acquainted with low-level languages every day. Outside of programming my interests include art, green energy, and exploring Utah.
